        <p>Hello! I'm Brady Mitchelmore, a Computer Science student with a passion for smart systems and data analysis. I'm currently studying at Memorial University of Newfoundland, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Smart Systems).</p>
        <p>I have a diverse set of skills in various programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Java, and C. I am also proficient with frameworks like Flask, React, and TensorFlow, and tools such as Visual Studio Code, Git, and AWS Cloud.</p>
        <p>My interest in technology extends beyond the classroom. I've worked on projects that involve building web applications, automating tasks, and processing unstructured documents using machine learning techniques.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic and project work, I have experience in different roles including an Automation Engineer, Order Fulfillment Associate, and Warehouse Associate. These experiences have honed my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills.</p>
        <p>Outside of tech, I am passionate about hockey. I played for Team NL menâ€™s hockey team at the Canada Winter Games in February 2019. I also enjoy volunteering, having assisted with hockey camps for the Northeast Eagles.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my projects and blog posts to learn more about my work and interests. Thank you for visiting my personal website!</p>
