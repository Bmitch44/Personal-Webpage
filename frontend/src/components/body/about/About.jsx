            <div className="about-content">
                <p>Hello! I'm Brady Mitchelmore, a dedicated Computer Science student with a keen interest in smart systems and data analysis. I am currently studying at Memorial University of Newfoundland, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Smart Systems). My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in advanced algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, all of which fuel my passion for technology.</p>
                <p>Throughout my studies, I've developed a diverse set of technical skills. I'm proficient in several programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, and C. My experience extends to frameworks and libraries such as Flask, React, and TensorFlow, which I use to build robust and scalable applications. I'm also skilled in using various tools like Visual Studio Code, Git, AWS Cloud, and Docker, which streamline my development process and enhance my productivity.</p>
                <p>Beyond the classroom, my passion for technology drives me to undertake various projects that challenge and expand my capabilities. I've built interactive web applications, automated mundane tasks, and developed tools for processing unstructured data using machine learning techniques. One of my notable projects is a personal webpage built with React and Python, where I showcase my skills and projects. Another project, Jarvis, is an Apple Shortcut I developed to automate quick note-taking in Notion, utilizing Groq and Notion APIs for seamless integration.</p>
                <p>My technical journey is complemented by my professional experiences in different roles. As an Automation Engineer at Infomatix, I automated several tasks that significantly improved data exchange efficiency. My time as an Order Fulfillment Associate at Sportchek and a Warehouse Associate at Canadian Tire taught me the importance of precision, reliability, and teamwork. These roles have honed my problem-solving abilities and equipped me with a versatile skill set that I bring to every project I undertake.</p>
                <p>Outside the realm of technology, I have a deep passion for hockey. I had the honor of playing for Team NL men's hockey team at the Canada Winter Games in February 2019. This experience not only enhanced my physical and strategic skills but also instilled in me the values of teamwork, perseverance, and leadership. I continue to give back to the community by volunteering at hockey camps for the Northeast Eagles, sharing my knowledge and passion with young aspiring players.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy staying updated with the latest advancements in AI and machine learning, reading tech blogs, and experimenting with new programming languages and frameworks. I'm always eager to learn and embrace new challenges that push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills.</p>
                <p>Feel free to explore my projects and blog posts to learn more about my work and interests. Thank you for visiting my personal website!</p>
